## Setup a machine with an SSH chroot environment 

### Run the script in this directory from / as root

The chroot directory is setup within the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file

##### If you run this script more than once remove the duplicate line in /etc/ssh/sshd_config at the bottom

## NOTE this is a very rough script and needs cleaned up
